Hello, I’m the Prompt Architect.

My role is to help you design a master prompt that will prime a new AI to act as a specialized expert in your chosen domain.

To begin, could you tell me the general field or domain of expertise you’d like this AI assistant to specialize in?

You said:
I am trying to collect and aggregate data from the web, this will include getting the data from HTML pages and APIs
ChatGPT said:

Great — so you want an AI expert that focuses on web data collection and aggregation.

To start shaping this persona: when you say collecting data from HTML pages and APIs, are you envisioning this expert as more of a developer persona (e.g., writing Python scripts with libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, handling APIs, etc.), or more of a data operations persona (e.g., guiding workflows, ETL processes, aggregation pipelines, cloud services)?

You said:
developer persona
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — a developer persona.

To refine this: when you think about this expert developer, do you see them primarily working in Python (with tools like requests, httpx, BeautifulSoup, lxml, Selenium, Playwright) or do you prefer another language/platform (JavaScript/Node.js, Go, etc.) as their main toolkit?

You said:
I want to use what ever language is most commonly used for this type of project
ChatGPT said:

Got it — the most common choice for web data collection and aggregation projects is Python, because of its mature ecosystem for:

Web scraping (requests, httpx, BeautifulSoup, lxml, Selenium, Playwright).

API interaction (requests, httpx, aiohttp).

Data handling (pandas, json, csv, sqlite3).

Python is generally considered the industry standard for this domain.

Before I summarize the persona: do you want this expert to also bring in best practices for scaling and maintainability (e.g., rotating proxies, respecting rate limits, designing reusable scraping modules), or should the focus stay strictly on basic scripts to fetch and parse data?

You said:
yes, use best practices
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7s

Excellent. To tailor the expert, what kinds of sources will you target—static HTML pages, JS-rendered sites (needing a headless browser), and/or authenticated APIs—and do any of them require login or complex pagination?

You said:
I am targeting the steam store and steam user profiles. I don't expect to need any login info. I am not sure about pagination
ChatGPT said:

Great—Steam store and user profiles.

What specific data fields do you want from (a) store pages and (b) user profile pages? (e.g., appid, title, price, discount, release date, tags; and for profiles: SteamID64, persona name, country, games owned, playtime, badges, etc.)

You said:
I don't care about the price for now. or data about the individual accounts. only their games libraries
ChatGPT said:

Understood—just users’ game libraries.

Would you prefer to fetch libraries via the Steam Web API (requires an API key but is stable and structured) or scrape public profile pages (no API key, but more brittle and slower)?

You said:
I will not have access to API keys. so we need to rely on the public profile pages
ChatGPT said:

Thanks—scraping public Steam profiles it is.

What runtime and tooling constraints should this expert assume: is a headless browser (Playwright/Selenium) acceptable for JS-rendered pages, or must it stick to HTTP-only fetching (requests/httpx + HTML parsing) with no browser automation?

You said:
what ever you think has the best chance of success
ChatGPT said:

Great. What output format and storage do you want for the aggregated libraries—CSV files, JSONL, or a database (e.g., SQLite/Postgres)—and where should the data land (local disk vs. cloud bucket)?

You said:
as for storage I want everything to be stored locally. As for the format, I want to do lots of filtering and sorting once I have the data. I want to use the format that is most suited for that use
ChatGPT said:

For heavy filtering/sorting locally, would you prefer SQLite (simple, built-in, great for incremental scraping) or DuckDB + Parquet (faster analytics on larger datasets, columnar, easy to query)?

You said:
The dataset will have approximately 1600 entries. is that a lot of data for SQLite?
ChatGPT said:

1600 rows is tiny by database standards—SQLite can comfortably handle millions.

Given your scale and need for easy local filtering/sorting, SQLite is the simplest and most robust fit.

👉 So here’s what I have so far:

Domain: Web data collection/aggregation developer.

Persona: Python developer expert in scraping (requests/Playwright + BeautifulSoup/lxml), data pipelines, and best practices (rate limits, retries, modular code).

Scope: Collect Steam user game libraries by scraping public profile pages.

Storage: Store results in SQLite for easy filtering/sorting.

Practices: Error handling, pagination (if needed), and reusable design.

Does this summary match what you want the expert persona to look like, or would you like to tweak anything before I draft your Master Prompt?

You said:
I will never need to scale past the 10,000 so I guess I don't need to scale really. that is my only tweak
ChatGPT said:

Perfect—that’s a clear boundary. SQLite is absolutely fine up to 10k entries, so no need to design for big scaling.

Here’s the finalized Master Prompt for your expert persona:

### MASTER PROMPT: The Web Data Collection Expert

You are The Web Data Collection Expert. Your persona is that of a seasoned Python developer who specializes in scraping and aggregating data from the web, with deep knowledge of tools like requests, httpx, BeautifulSoup, lxml, and when necessary, browser automation frameworks like Playwright or Selenium. You are pragmatic, efficiency-oriented, and always apply best practices such as respecting rate limits, handling errors gracefully, and designing modular, reusable code.

Your primary goal is to interview a user to understand a specific project or task they are trying to achieve within the domain of web data collection and aggregation, and then generate a final, specific prompt that instructs another AI to implement the solution.

### Guiding Principles

One-at-a-Time: You must operate in a strict one-question-at-a-time interactive mode.

Value the simplest, most robust solution that meets the user’s goal.

Maintain best practices for web scraping, but avoid unnecessary complexity.

Ask clarifying questions to uncover exact data targets, formats, and constraints.

Suggest potential pitfalls (pagination, dynamic content, captchas), but do not overcomplicate.

Avoid being overly verbose or formulaic in your interactions.

### Methodology

Project Interview: Interview the user to deconstruct the specific project or problem they need to solve (e.g., what site to scrape, what data fields to capture, where to store it).

Solution Design: Once you have a clear understanding, propose a high-level plan for scraping, parsing, and storing the data.

Generate Implementer Prompt: After the user approves the plan, generate a final prompt for the “Implementer” AI. This prompt must be simple, pragmatic, and designed to produce a direct solution that meets requirements without bloat. It must include all necessary context, instructions, and constraints, and instruct the “Implementer” AI to adhere to the same Guiding Principles above.

✅ This persona will help you design Python scripts that scrape Steam public user profile pages to extract game libraries, and store the results in a local SQLite database for filtering/sorting. You’ve clarified that your dataset will never exceed 10,000 entries, so scalability concerns are minimal.

Do you want me to also create a ready-to-use Implementer Prompt (so you could immediately hand it off to an AI to generate the scraper), or do you just want to stop with this reusable Expert Master Prompt?
